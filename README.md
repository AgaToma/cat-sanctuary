<h1>Site description</h1>
This website was designed and built for educational practice and is about a fictional cat shelter - Laois Cat Sancturary, the idea of which was created for the purpose of this project. The website is to enable users to find information about the shelter's profile, scope of activities, animals in their care and location. The purpose is also to encourage new volunteers to sign up and support the shelter. It's a static, responsive website built with HTML & CSS as basic technologies at this time, further features can be added at later time with Javascript and a database.

<h1>Testing</h1> 
<h2>Responsiveness</h2>

<p>Website was developed and tested for responsiveness using Developer Tools in Chrome. To ensure optimal website look for best user experience for screen sizes starting from 320px the below wiewport size breakpoints were applied:</p>
<ul>
    <li>above 1500px</li>
    <li>1400px - 1500px</li>
    <li>1000px - 1399px</li>
    <li>1000px - 1399px</li>
    <li>650px - 999px</li>
    <li>751px - 999px - for signup form only</li>
    <li>430px - 651px</li>
    <li>320px - 430px</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing was done by applying breakpoints in the Dimensions section by setting it to responsive. To ensure the website's look is as desired between the breakpoints, the responsive testing window was manually dragged to increase/decrease width.</p>

<h3>Expected behaviour:</h3>
Website is responsive on all screen sizes with photos not being pixelated or stretched, no scrollbars are appearing except for the one in the design. 

<h3>Actual behaviour:</h3>
As expected.

<h3>Devices the site was tested on for responsiveness (no issues found)</h3>
<p>Asus E406M + external Dell monitor</p>
<p>Asus E406M</p>
<p>Dell Latitute 5400</p>
<p>Lenovo Tab M10</p>
<p>iPhone XR</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy 8+</p>

<h4>Browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari</h4>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

Tested with [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool.
<p>Care was taken throughout the project to ensure accessibility via</p>
<ul>
    <li>aria labels were added to all external links</li>
    <li>alternative text was added to non backround images</li>
    <li>description was added between video tags</li>
    <li>using a balanced color pallette to ensure user friendly contrast</li>
</ul>

<p>During testing of the completed signup form and error was found where orange submit button combined with white bold text was not meeting contrast criteria, this was fixed by changing button color to darker green, after which the button passed the accessibility test.</p>
<p>No other errors were found</p>

    <li>There is only background music in the video and description was added between the video tags</li>
</ol>
